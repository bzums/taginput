jquery.taginput
========
jQuery plugin for creating tags in an input field.
I am aware of the fact that there are already a couple of implementations for this usecase. 

For example, there is a nice implementation for [jQuery UI](https://github.com/aehlke/tag-it) and [Bootstrap](https://github.com/TimSchlechter/bootstrap-tagsinput). 

I am trying to combine the best parts of existing implementations and to provide a plugin which is independent of any (ui-)frontend framework (for example jQuery UI or Bootstrap).

## Usage
